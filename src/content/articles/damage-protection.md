## Our Damage Protection Policy

We take great care to ensure that your custom cards arrive in perfect condition. However, we understand that shipping damages can occasionally occur. That's why we offer comprehensive damage protection for all our products.

### What's Covered

Our damage protection policy covers:
- Cards damaged during shipping
- Manufacturing defects
- Printing errors
- Color discrepancies
- Structural damage to the card

### How to Report Damage

If your card arrives damaged, please follow these steps:

1. Take clear photos of the damage
2. Email the photos to [support@yourstore.com](mailto:support@yourstore.com) within 7 days of receiving your order
3. Include your order number in the subject line
4. Briefly describe the damage in the email

### Our Resolution Process

Once we receive your damage report, our team will review it within 1-2 business days. After confirming the damage, we will offer one of the following solutions:

- **Replacement:** We'll produce and ship a new card to you at no additional cost
- **Partial refund:** If the damage is minor and doesn't affect the overall appearance
- **Full refund:** In cases where replacement isn't possible or desired

> **Important Note:** Please keep the damaged item until your case is resolved. We may ask you to return it using a prepaid shipping label that we'll provide.

### Prevention Tips

While our packaging is designed to protect your cards during shipping, here are some tips to ensure your cards remain in excellent condition after arrival:

- Keep cards away from direct sunlight to prevent fading
- Avoid placing cards in areas with high humidity
- When handling, touch the edges rather than the printed surface
- For wall-mounted cards, ensure proper installation using the provided hardware
