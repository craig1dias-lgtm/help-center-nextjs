## Our Money Back Guarantee

We're confident you'll love your custom card, which is why we offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, we're here to make it right.

### Our Promise to You

We stand behind the quality of our products and want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason you're not happy with your custom card, we offer:

- **30-day money-back guarantee** for unused, undamaged items
- **Free replacements** for manufacturing defects
- **Partial refunds** for minor issues
- **Full refunds** for major issues that can't be resolved

### Eligibility for Refunds

To be eligible for a full refund, your item must be:

1. In the same condition that you received it
2. Unused and undamaged
3. In the original packaging (when applicable)
4. Requested within 30 days of delivery

### How to Request a Refund

If you wish to request a refund, please follow these steps:

1. Contact our support team at [support@yourstore.com](mailto:support@yourstore.com)
2. Include your order number in the subject line
3. Explain the reason for your refund request
4. Attach photos if relevant (for damaged items)

Our team will review your request and respond within 1-2 business days with next steps.

### Refund Process

Once your refund is approved:

1. We'll send you a confirmation email
2. You may be asked to return the item (we'll provide a prepaid shipping label)
3. Once the item is received and inspected, we'll process your refund
4. The refund will be credited to your original payment method within 5-10 business days

### Exceptions and Special Cases

While we strive to make every customer happy, there are some situations where refunds may be limited:

- **Customized items:** Since our cards are made-to-order with your specifications, refunds for "change of mind" are generally not provided unless there's a quality issue.
- **Digital designs:** Once a digital design has been approved and production has begun, we cannot offer refunds for design changes.
- **Shipping costs:** Original shipping costs are non-refundable unless the item arrived damaged or defective.

### Our Quality Commitment

We take pride in the quality of our products and thoroughly inspect each card before shipping. If you receive a card with any manufacturing defects, we'll gladly replace it at no additional cost to you.

If you have any questions about our Money Back Guarantee, please don't hesitate to [contact our support team](/articles/contact-us).
